attaavv - ascii table to array and vice versa in C!

----------------------------------------
About this tool
----------------------------------------
attaavv will read an ascii table of data (separated by space or 
comma) and save the table as a C array of doubles along with 
possible comments and other relevant information into a C 
structure. Components of the structure are explained bellow. 
It is written fully in C89. The input table must not contain 
any non-numeric elements in this version of attaavv. This is 
a very simple program, only meant to do the most basic input 
and output of tabular numerical data in a nicely formated way. 

attaavv is not a standalone program, it is made to be placed 
inside a C program in order to read an ascii table and save the
result as a 1D C array (for a 2D array look bellow). Refer to
the example file for a simple example.

The program has lots of comments to explain every step.

The output is a 1D array containing all the data which you can use
by indexing the output with [i*n2+j] where n2 is the second
axis size and i and j are the first and second axis indexes 
respectively. To convert to a 2D array read bellow.

----------------------------------------
Output structure
----------------------------------------
The function fills in the ArrayInfo structure definition, declared
in attaavv.h. The components include (in order): 

1. Number of header (comment) lines.
2. Array of pointers to comments.
3. Number of rows (zeroth axis) in the data table.
4. Number of columns (first axis) in the data table.
5. Data array (1D).


----------------------------------------
Running the example:
----------------------------------------
In order to test run the example, put the two .h and .c files in the
src directory and run ($ is the shell prompt on the command line):

    $ make
    $ ./ui

A text file called tempcat.txt should be made showing the data it 
read from the ascii data in the data folder.

----------------------------------------
Converting output to 2D:
----------------------------------------
In case you want your output to be two dimensional, you can simply
create a pointer to a pointer array on top of the output:

In the declarations:

    int i;
    double **TwoDarray;

After calling readasciitable

    TwoDarray=malloc(intable.s0 * sizeof(double *));
    for (i = 0; i < intable.s0; i++)
        TwoDarray[i] = &intable.d[i*intable.s1];

To test it:

    printf("%f\n", TwoDarray[0][2]);

Free the space in the end

    free(TwoDarray);

----------------------------------------
Formatting input parameters to writeasciitable
----------------------------------------
writeasciitable receives four input arrays, besides the table stack
and the output name, they are: int_cols, accu_cols, space, prec.
writeasciitable assumes that unless a column is defined as the
first two of the above, its printf formatting string is like this:
%-[minspace].[numdecimals]g (scientific notation). [minspace] and 
[numdecimals] are set by the space[1], prec[0] inputs.

<ol>
<li><b>int_cols:</b>This array tells the function which columns are integers.
            The last element has to be negative in order to signal
            the end. The minimum space parameter for the %-[minspace]d
            is set by space[0].</li>
<li><b>accu_cols:</b>In some cases, we are dealing with a float that requires
            very high accuracy compared to the other inputs, in this
            case you can specify which columns have this condition
            in this array. Like int_cols, the last element has to
            be -1. The formatting for these columns will be assumed 
            to be like this: %-[minspace].[numdecimals]f, [minspace]
            is determined by space[2] and [numdecimals] by prec[1].</li>
<li><b>space:</b>  This array shows how much space should be allocated to 
            each kind of column as explained above.</li>
            
<li><b>prec:</b>This array shows the level of precision (significant 
            numbers for the general type and number of decimal points
            for the extra precision columns) as explained above.</li>
</ol>
