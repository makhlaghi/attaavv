attaavv - ascii table to array and vice versa in C!

----------------------------------------
About this tool
----------------------------------------
attaavv will read an ascii table of data (separated by space or 
comma) and save the table and possible comments along with 
relevant information (number of rows and columns of the data 
and number of comments) into a C structure. It is written fully 
in C89. The input table must not contain any non-numeric 
elements in this version of attaavv.

attaavv is not a standalone program, it is made to be placed 
inside a C program in order to read an ascii table and save the
result as a 1D C array (for a 2D array look bellow). Refer to
the example file for a simple example.

The program has lots of comments to explain every step.

The output is a 1D array containing all the data which you can use
by indexing the output with [i*n2+j] where n2 is the second
axis size and i and j are the first and second axis indexes 
respectively. To convert to a 2D array read bellow.

----------------------------------------
Running the example:
----------------------------------------
In order to test run the example, put the two .h and .c files in the
src directory and run ($ is the shell prompt on the command line):
$ make
$ ./ui
A text file called tempcat.txt should be made showing the data it 
read from the ascii data in the data folder.

----------------------------------------
Converting output to 2D:
----------------------------------------
In case you want your output to be two dimensional, you can simply
create a pointer to a pointer array on top of the output:

<-- In the declarations: -->
    int i;
    double **TwoDarray;

<-- After calling readasciitable -->
    TwoDarray=malloc(intable.s0 * sizeof(double *));
    for (i = 0; i < intable.s0; i++)
        TwoDarray[i] = &intable.d[i*intable.s1];

<-- To test it: -->
    printf("%f\n", TwoDarray[0][2]);

<-- Free the space in the end -->
    free(TwoDarray);

----------------------------------------
Formatting input parameters to writeasciitable
----------------------------------------
writeasciitable receives four input arrays, besides the table stack
and the output name, they are: int_cols, accu_cols, space, prec.
writeasciitable assumes that unless a column is defined as the
first two of the above, its printf formatting string is like this:
%-[minspace].[numdecimals]g (scientific notation). [minspace] and 
[numdecimals] are set by the space[1], prec[0] inputs.

int_cols:   This array tells the function which columns are integers.
            The last element has to be negative in order to signal
            the end. The minimum space parameter for the %-[minspace]d
            is set by space[0].
accu_cols:  In some cases, we are dealing with a float that requires
            very high accuracy compared to the other inputs, in this
            case you can specify which columns have this condition
            in this array. Like int_cols, the last element has to
            be -1. The formatting for these columns will be assumed 
            to be like this: %-[minspace].[numdecimals]f, [minspace]
            is determined by space[2] and [numdecimals] by prec[1].
space:      This array shows how much space should be allocated to 
            each kind of column as explained above.
prec:       This array shows the level of precision (significant 
            numbers for the general type and number of decimal points
            for the extra precision columns) as explained above.
